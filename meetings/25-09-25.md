# Minutes

* NB set up calls, call for reviewer and funding calls.

## New actions

Federated project had a meeting this week in person 

### Reviewers and funding calls

Lots of funding calls coming from projects, some just out and others being released in the next month or so

Started discussion around reviewing, Samantha talking to Charlotte about eligability rules. Anyone funded had assumed UKRI eligable, but apparently not the case as flexible fund for distributed to individuals potentially. Also assume 80% FeC, but might consider 100% FeC if appropriate - will get confirmation from NERC next week. Johnathan said to discuss with institutions contract office what they will allow wrt a lead a funding project, UCL says have to be trusted to distribute the funds. Key is the lead and they can distribute as appropriate. Johnathan said when applied 100% FeC is allowed for industry, an institution normally getting 80% would get it too, terms get passed on here. 

Johnathan said put out a call for reviewers, 7 responses so far and are happy for their details to be shared with the rest of the group. Useful to build up names of reviewers and to share. Neil and Johnathan got some extra money to do a panel rover scheme to explore how these are run to do some analysis of this. Neil followed on from Samantha, found from going through this - depends on lead organisation policies. Have been able to give 100% FeC even to research individuals but not the organisations themselves e.g. travel bursary funding. Also to highlight on reviewing side the confidentiality agreements, extreme push back about hiring reviewers that outside UK/EU/NZ as don't think can come up with a confidentiality agreement that can cover them. Proably not impact here too much, but challenge with reviewers from the US here. Also, if paying your reviewers then some have backed out as on skilled worker visas, limitation of 20 hours a week (or month?) on top of this, even only propose 14 hours of extra work - not willing to take risk might accidently go over the limit. Been communicated with UKRI as wider impact here.

Helen said if get reviewers and hold a central name list, a common pool, then CAKE can be central and act as a single point of truth. 

Samatha said might be worth sharing reviews between DRI projects, could we review for each other? Applications will register their interest, maybe an internal list of each other. 

Lucy said in Imperial meeting had discussion around grant application platforms, which we would use and potentially to share costs of good grants? Maybe have moved on from this? CHARTERED using good grants, but on the back of SSI. So maybe no point discussing but being mentioned. Samantha said thought about it, but costs prohibitive - platform a considerable amount wrt the project amount. Next time will specifically put in as the budget. People have found a way round it, give time then can do with other approaches. Neil said can give more information about experiences using Good grants, but SSI have noticed good grants not good at handling conflicts of interest - but to be fair is hard to do. Might be something can share experiences around how we do this and consistent conflict of interest policy across funds. https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/About CMT is free.

## DRI congress

Lots of people at it, and lots of sessions. Eleanor running CAKE session and after people being involved, interactive session around identifying common challenges and discussing solutions. Looking for speakers and good positive actions for solving challenges that you think other people are facing. Please reach out to Eleanor for this. 

Nick said unsure what will be like - congress sounds very grant. Neil said first one was all about people in a room and splitting into groups. ig ddifference is that these are being run y the projects themselves. 

### SC

Nick shared UK university booth, and STFC one - both DRI and now in discussion. Lots of people will be there. Can take things. Helen said sharing why UK is great for DRI, forward thinking and can be a great place to come for tallent and present as DRI. Future looking. Nick mentioned booklet idea, Jo said have booklets of what has been funded and then got them to present. 

Helen said a nice idea, can share with Universities even - lots happening and people don't know!

### CIUK

Jo said next CIUK meeting will confirm program, have emailed round to say 90 min slot or so in main program. Each network plus will give a lightening session and then a panel discussion about this. UKRI will send someone to talk about the overall goal around this. Timing confirmed next Tuesday, got lots of positive responses so that's great and busy session. 

Will be a CAKE/DRI booth at CIUK and chance to advertise things there. 

#### Calendar etc

Challenges viewing this for some people. Internal calendar of upcoming funding would be good. 

Unified application was discussed, challenge around large vs small. But capturing logistic/proforma information might be suitable then can share demographics etc across the board. A discussion was held around how capturing EDI information, Samantha said optional for CoSaR and those who are successful have to provide information - these could be standardised across network. Nick said could collect centrally - if allowed, then can grab high level statistics across the board.
